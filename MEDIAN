Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

SET @rowindex := -1;
 
SELECT
   ROUND(AVG(l.LAT_N),4) as Median
FROM
   (SELECT @rowindex:=@rowindex + 1 AS rowindex,
           STATION.LAT_N AS LAT_N
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY  STATION.LAT_N) AS l
WHERE
l.rowindex IN (FLOOR(@rowindex / 2), CEIL(@rowindex / 2));

Explanation :

1. Beginning with the internal subquery â€“ the select assigns @rowindex as an incremental index for each latitudes that is selected and sorts the latitudes.
2. Once we have the sorted list of latitudes, the outer query will fetch the middle items in the array. If the array contains an odd number of items, both values will be the single middle value.
3. Then, the SELECT clause of the outer query returns the average of those two values as the median value.
